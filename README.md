# INST-377
## Materials and resources for class
Rebecca Parks Follman

This repo provides course materials for INST 377.
Each folder has brief explanations about the topic and source code, if any. 

For the topics in the class, get familiar with command line tools (e.g., Git Shell, Bash, Terminal). Of course, using a command line tool instead of GUIs is not intuitive, but many operations require only basic commands. Don't worry.

Most of the course slides are available on ELMS.
